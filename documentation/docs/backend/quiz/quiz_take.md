# Quiz Take App

## Overview and Motivation

The quiz_take app provides back-end endpoints for the front-end to access using a REST API.

## TODO: explain all of the different endpoints



## Testing

Unit tests can be run from within the backend Docker container using the command `python manage.py test` (more verbosely if executing from a terminal not SSH'd into the container: `docker exec -it elucidate_server python manage.py test`). Ensure you are executing the command from the same directory as `manage.py`.
