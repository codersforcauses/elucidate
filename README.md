## Getting started

### Setting environment variables

1. Get in touch with a Elcuidate committee member to get the `.env` file for the project.
2. Add the `.env` file to the root folder of the project (do not delete or replace `.env.example`).

### Setup Python development enivorment

Download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 3.10.5 is recommended, but any 3.10.x version should work.

Note: you will have to update Python if you are using the default one on mac os. To update just download and install latest Python.

#### Install Poetry

Poetry is a better Python package manager than pip. Download and install Poetry from [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Run the following command to configure virtual environments to be created in the project directory: `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`

#### Install Python dependencies

On mac os install postgresql `brew install postgresql`, this requires [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

From the `server` directory, run the following command to install dependencies: `poetry install`

#### Activate the virtual environment

if you are using VS Code

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`
- Type in `Python: Select Interpreter`
- Choose the virtual environment in the project directory.
- Kill and restart the terminal.

If you are using a terminal

- Type in `source .venv/bin/activate`

### Run server

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ you should see something if all went well.

### Setup NodeJS development environment

Install NodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/). 16.15.1 LTS is recommended, but any 16.x LTS version should work.

#### Install Yarn

Yarn is a better NodeJS package manager than npm. Download and install Yarn by using the following command: `npm install --global yarn`

#### Install NodeJS dependencies

From the `client` directory, run the following command to install dependencies: `yarn install`

#### Run client

```sh
yarn dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000/ should see something if all went well

### Install Recommended VS Code extensions

1. Open a VS Code window from the `server` directory.
2. Open the extensions tab on the left bar of VS Code.
3. Search for `@recommended`.
4. Install all extensions under the `workspace recommendations` tab.s
5. Repeat the above but open a VS Code window from the `client` directory to install the frontend extensions.

## Setup commitlint

Commitlint is a tool that enforces your commits to be semantically formatted under the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

Commitlint should have been automatically installed by the `yarn install` command.

### Install Husky

Husky is a tool that automatically manages your git hooks. For this project, I have configured Husky to run `commitlint` before each commit.

Husky can be installed by using the following command in the `client` directory: `yarn prepare`.

Then run the following command from the root directory to make Husky executable: `chmod a+x .husky/commit-msg`.

### Conventional commit messages

Your commit messages **and** pull requests should be in the following format.

```none
Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

<scope> is optional, but highly recommended

Example
feat(core): add hat wobble
^--^^----^  ^------------^
|   |       |
|   |       +-> Subject: Summary in present tense and in lowercase.
|   +---------> scope: What is the scope of the change?
+-------------> Type: Description of the type of change.
```

#### Types

More types can be added if neccessary in the `commitlint.config.js` file.

The commit type must be of the following:

- `feat:` (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix:` (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs:` (changes to the documentation)
- `style:` (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor:` (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test:` (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore:` (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
- `build:` (changes related to the build process)
- `perf:` (increasing performance)
- `revert:` (reverting a commit)
- `ci:` (continuous integration related changes. We won't be using this; instead we will be using the ci and cd scopes for devops related changes.)

#### Scopes

More scopes can be added if neccessary in the `commitlint.config.js` file. If there are overlapping scopes in your commit/pull request, choose the most suitable scope.
<br>
The commit scope must be of the following or blank:

- `core:` (core functionality changes)
- `linting:` (linting related changes)
- `frontend:` (frontend changes)
- `backend:` (backend changes)
- `auth:` (authenication changes)
- `styles:` (changes to the styling)
- `config:` (changes to the configuration)
- `misc:` (other miscellaneous changes)
- `ci:` (changes to the continuous integration)
- `cd:` (changes to the continuous delivery)

## Writing documentations

We will be using MkDocs to generate the documentations for this project. MkDocs is a documentation generator that is based on Markdown.

### Using MkDocs

1. Assuming you have a Python development set up and Poetry is installed, open a VS Code session from he documentation directory.
2. Run `poetry install` to install MkDocs and related dependencies.
3. Run `poetry run mkdocs serve` to open a development server.
4. Change VS Code indentation size to 4 spaces.
5. Start documenting!

## Development workflow

1. Decide as a team the issue/s you want to work on.
2. Assign yourselves to the relevant issue on GitHub.
3. A branch corresponding to the issue should be created (unless it is a point 5 issue).
4. checkout the branch corresponding to the issue. It should be in the format of `i<issue number>-<issue_name>`
5. Work on your changes.
6. Make commits and push them to the issue branch.
7. Open a pull request on GitHub.
8. Await for code reviews.
9. Your feature is merged!
10. Delete your local branch with `git branch -d <branch_name>`.
